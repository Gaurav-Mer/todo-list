Frontend (React):
Create React Components:

Design components for subscription selection, payment form, and confirmation.
Fetch Subscription Plans:

Retrieve subscription plans from your backend. You can create API endpoints in your Node.js server to fetch the plans from Stripe.
Display Subscription Options:

Present subscription options to the user with details such as duration and price. Allow users to select a plan.
Payment Form:

Implement a payment form where users can enter their payment details. Use the Stripe Elements library to securely collect card information.
Handle Payment Submission:

On form submission, send the payment information to your Node.js server.

Backend (Node.js):
Set Up Server Routes:

Create routes on your Node.js server to handle subscription-related requests. Use a library like Express for routing.
Fetch Subscription Plans from Stripe:

Use the Stripe API in your backend to fetch subscription plans. Ensure that your server has the necessary secret key for authentication.
Create Checkout Session:

When a user decides to purchase a subscription, create a checkout session on your server using the Stripe API. Specify the details of the subscription plan and the payment method.
Handle Webhooks (Optional):

Implement webhook handlers to listen for events such as successful payments. This allows you to update your database and grant access to the user when a payment is confirmed.
Handle Payment Intent:

Use Stripe's PaymentIntent to confirm the payment on the server side. This is especially important for handling 3D Secure payments and ensuring secure transactions.
Confirm Payment and Grant Access:

Once the payment is confirmed, update your database to reflect the user's active subscription status and grant access to premium features.
